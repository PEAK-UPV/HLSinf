 - Solve the timing violation at write module for CPO>4. 
   Suggestion: Flatten the write_data_channels_loop_blocks and write_data_channels_loop_cpo loops manually
   Suggestion: block_offset does not need to be partitioned as the loop is pipelined

 - 8x8 FP32 does not converge in block-level synthesis (try Vitis 2020.2)
   Suggestion, reduce HMAX to 128 and try
   Target SLR0 (larger than SLR1) - PEAK6 (4x8)
   Unbound design to SLR and check performance
