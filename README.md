# HLSinf
High-Level Synthesis inference accelerator for FPGAs

This project targets inference processes on FPGA systems. For this, HLS is used as the main
programming language (C++ with HLS pragmas).

It is highly recommended to use vitis_hls to work with the project. In order to launch vitis_hls and work with the project you need to first set the environment variables and then launch vitis_hls and open the project:

cd <HLSinf directory>
source scripts/setenv.sh
vitis_hls

(the project is located at <HLSinf directory>/project/HLSinf)
